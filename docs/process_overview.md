### Cyclic Rating Process Overview
Start the model with initial oil temperature of zero.

Iterate until oil temperature stabilises for given daily load shape.

Increment load magnitude until one of the passed limits are breached.

In this case the winding hotspot temperature has reached 120 degrees.
